                        Herbs have their own soothing effect. The process of sipping and swallowing something warm and
                        soothing can relax the brain and body. “For example one study published in March 2013 in the
                        Journal of Psychopharmacology suggests chamomile may reduce anxiety by helping rewire the body's
                        stress response, and increasing production of the feel-good hormones serotonin and dopamine.”

                        “Dark chocolate, which is rich in antioxidants, can also lower levels of stress hormones in the
                        body, according to a Swiss study published in the Journal of Proteome Research in which
                        participants had eaten about 1.5 ounces (oz) of the treat per day for two weeks. Just be sure to
                        avoid excess calories in your diet by not overindulging in chocolate, advises Meyerowitz. Keep
                        serving size in mind with dark chocolate, as the calories can add up quickly. Stick to a 1-oz
                        serving or less of at least 60 percent cacao dark chocolate daily.”

                        “Low-carb keto diet followers, take note: The right carbs can act as stress busters! According
                        to MIT, carbohydrates can increase levels of serotonin, a chemical in the body that helps boost
                        mood and reduce stress. More serotonin means more concentration and a more productive workday.
                        But picking the right carbs is critical. Refined carbs — such as chips, cookies, and crackers —
                        are tied to inflammation, stress, and depression, according to a May 2010 study in Psychosomatic
                        Medicine. These carbs may also raise your blood pressure, straining your heart health, suggests
                        a 2016 review in Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases, and lead you to overeat later in the day,
                        other research suggests. Complex carbs, on the other hand, can do wonders for your stress levels
                        because they digest more slowly and keep blood sugar levels more even, according to Harvard
                        Medical School. Sources of complex carbs include sweet potatoes and whole grains (such as
                        whole-grain bread, quinoa, brown rice, and steel-cut or old-fashioned oats).”

                        of which plummet during stressful times. A preliminary study published in Neuropharmacology also
                        found that magnesium deficiency increased depression and anxiety symptoms in mice. Bananas are
                        furthermore a rich source of certain B vitamins, such as vitamin B6, which helps the nervous
                        system run correctly, and can decrease stress and fatigue, according to a July 2010 study in
                        Psychopharmacology that looked at the use of high-dose B-complex vitamins. An added perk: The
                        potassium bananas offer can help lower high blood pressure, according to Harvard Medical

                        your mood, to boot. Heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids in whole fish like tuna, halibut, salmon,
                        and sardines may help ease depression, suggests a September 2015 review in Journal of
                        Epidemiology & Community Health. Lowering overall stress and anxiety is another possible
                        benefit, according to a study in the August 2015 Clinical Psychopharmacology and Neuroscience.”

                        can help ward off unhealthy cravings. Second, they could help lower blood pressure, according to
                        a July 2012 study in Hypertension, which focused on pistachios. And third, Meyerowitz says,
                        their B vitamins have been shown to help lower stress levels. Just remember to reach for only a
                        small handful, as nuts are calorie dense and can lead to weight gain if you eat too many.”

                        importance of hydration during stressful times is well-documented. Even mild dehydration can
                        increase cortisol levels, which contributes to increased stress, as described in a study in
                        Journal of Sports Sciences. While drinking enough water will not make your stressors vanish,
                        taking this step will help set your body up to handle stress when it does occur. According to
                        the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, the average woman needs about 2.7
                        liters of water per day, while the average man needs about 3.7. (About 80 percent of that
                        hydration should come from beverages, whereas the remaining 20 percent can come from food.)”

                        could also brighten your mood. A December 2012 study in Nutrition Research and Practice found

                        when people took 3,000 milligrams (mg) of vitamin C in a slow-release formula each day, their
                        cortisol levels, and overall stress, decreased. Eating citrus fruits, including oranges,
                        grapefruit, and strawberries, is a good start, but you would need a supplement to reach such
                        high levels of these nutrients. Speak with your doctor before adding vitamin C supplements to
